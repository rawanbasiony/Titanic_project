 Project Workflow
 
1. Load the data

    Read Titanic dataset CSV file.
        
    Data cleaning

    Drop the Cabin column

    Replace missing values in Age with the mean age

    Replace missing values in Embarked with 'S'

    Convert Age to integer type

2.Feature engineering

    Age_group: categorize passengers by age

    Fare_group: categorize passengers by ticket price

3. Data analysis

    Calculate survival rates by age

    Calculate survival rates by embarkation port (Embarked)

    Calculate survival rates by passenger class (Pclass)

    Calculate survival rates by ticket fare

4. Data visualization

    Age distribution (Histogram + KDE)

    Age distribution by survival

    Embarked port vs survival
    
    Fare distribution

    Fare distribution by survival

    Passenger class distribution
